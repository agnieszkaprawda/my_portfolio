Hello, my name is Agnieszka, I am going to visualise three data visualisations basing on the Stop & Search dataset. You can find more on the topic here:

# Summary
Let me write a short memo on my work and describe the story behind each graph. 

In the first data visualization I tried to find the most frequent object of search – which is the problem of smuggling drugs. The crime has been increasing throughout recent years not only overall but also in all ethnic groups and across both genders. 

In the second graph, I focused on locating the areas of London wherein the year 2020 all the crime connected to drug smuggling was the biggest problem. It turns out that most cases happened in the City of Westminster, Newnham, and Croydon. 

In the third graph, I found the time of the year, when all the crimes (especially “Controlled drugs” crimes) are most frequent. It turns out that throughout the time, the most popular season for the raise of cases in May.

In my work, I tried to implement all of the C.R.A.P. principles. I applied **_Contrast_** through adjusting colours to the type of graph – using different colours for different categories or to highlight a particular event, using hue to show the frequency of crimes in a particular location. **_Repetition_** – where needed the colours to stay consistent and repetitive for the most important messages on the graph to stand out. **_Alignment_** – I tried to allocate the information on my graphs clearly and transparently, so the visualization is easily understandable for the reader. **_Proximity_** – I tried to make the graphs in such a form that the similar clusters of cases are allocated similarly.

I also tried to implement all of Alberto Cairo's five qualities of great visualisaiton. 
1.	First of all, my graphs are **truthful**, not confusing, when it comes to colours as they tend to be the same throughout the whole file. I tried to use appropriate types of graphs to address different problems. 
2.	Second of all, my grpahs are **functional** and does not contain unnecessary information that could confuse the reader. 
3.	Moreover, I tried to make my graphs **beautiful** to make them easier to read – I used pleasant colours, fonts, and themes.
4.	What’s more, thanks to the **insightful** aspect of the graphs, we can discover new pieces of information on crimes in London & build our knowledge on the topic.
5.	Finally, I tried to make the whole story **enlightening** and coherent so that the reader is interested in the data presented.

Thank you!
