### Oxford Hack 2020 - Meetable

What is Meetable?
Meetable is an app that enables you to find friends during the lockdown. It matches you with a small group of other students from your university every week and sets weekly challenges for you basing on your common interests.



As an Executive Committee member of the Entrepreneurship Club at London Business School, I decided to build on my passion for tech & startups.

Therefore, last weekend I joined my first hackathon organised by the University of Oxford - #OxfordHack2020 and created a marvelous team with Yash Dandavate, Samuel Ola, and Jason Zhao.

We spent 36 h working on the creation of the MVP - including the development of the UI & UX, logistics behind the product, ways of gaining revenue, and coding the backend & frontend of the app.

We came up with an idea related to enabling young people to socialize during COVID-19 times.

Within a few hours, we managed to conduct the survey and get 54 responses that confirm the viability of our idea.

It was an absolute pleasure to work with such fantastic, creative, and open people! Thank you so much team once again for making this experience so priceless and amusing!
