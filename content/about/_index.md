### Oxford Hack 2020 - Meetable

What is Meetable?
Meetable is an app that enables you to find friends during the lockdown. It matches you with a small group of other students from your university every week and sets weekly challenges for you basing on your common interests.




As an Executive Committee member of the Entrepreneurship Club at London Business School, I decided to build on my passion for tech & startups.
